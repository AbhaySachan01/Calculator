# Calculator
# Project Description:
The Basic Calculator project is a web-based application that allows users to perform simple arithmetic calculations in an intuitive and user-friendly manner. It provides a virtual calculator interface with a display area and a grid of buttons representing numbers, mathematical operators, and control functions.

# Features:

Calculator Interface: The web-based calculator presents a clean and organized user interface. It consists of a display area at the top to show the current calculation and result, and a grid of buttons below to input numbers and operators.

Responsive Design: The calculator is designed to be responsive, ensuring that it functions and looks well on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

Input and Display: Users can interact with the calculator by clicking on the virtual buttons representing numbers (0-9), mathematical operators (+, -, *, / ,** ,%), and control functions (equal sign (=), clear (AC)). The current input and calculation are displayed in the top display area.

Arithmetic Operations: Users can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division by clicking the corresponding operator buttons. The calculator can handle multi-step calculations.

Calculation: Upon clicking the equal sign (=) button, the calculator evaluates the input expression and displays the result in the display area. The JavaScript eval() function is used to perform the calculation.

Error Handling: The calculator handles errors gracefully. If an invalid expression is entered or an error occurs during calculation, the display shows an "Invalid Operation" message to alert the user.

Clear Function: The clear (AC) button allows users to reset the calculator, clearing the input and the display.

Styling: The calculator's user interface is styled using CSS to provide an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly design. Buttons change color on hover to enhance interactivity.

# Technologies Used:

HTML: The structure of the calculator user interface is created using HTML, including the display area and button grid.
CSS: Styling rules are applied using CSS to enhance the appearance of the calculator and make it responsive.
JavaScript: The calculator's functionality, including input handling, calculation, and error management, is implemented using JavaScript.
GitHub: The project is hosted on GitHub, allowing users to access and use the calculator through a web browser.

# How to Use:

Enter numbers and operators by clicking the corresponding buttons on the calculator interface.
To perform a calculation, click the equal sign (=) button. The result will be displayed in the top area.
To clear the input and display, click the clear (AC) button.
The calculator is designed to handle simple arithmetic operations and display results accurately.
